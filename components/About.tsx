    const bio = "Iâ€™m Enson, a hand poke tattoo artist based in Columbus, OH, for the past three years. My style is whimsical, cute, and old-fashioned, and I create custom, individual pieces that celebrate the weird and wonderful. I also offer flash tattoos for those who want something pre-designed but still unique. As a queer-friendly and trans artist, I provide a welcoming, inclusive space, taking great care to ensure a comfortable and exciting experience for every client. My meticulous hand poke technique makes each tattoo a unique and personal journey, reflecting my dedication to both my craft and my clients."
